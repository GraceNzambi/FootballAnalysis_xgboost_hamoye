# FootballAnalysis_xgboost_hamoye
Football Analysis project was a task assigned to XGBOOST group in an internship that I participated. 

Our group emerged the best. The project analyses a football dataset provided on kaggle URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/secareanualin/football-events

The aim of the project is to develop a mchine learning model to predict whether a goal will occur or not based on several events or conditions such as: loaction of the ball, body part, assist method,shot place  and corner
